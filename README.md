# Face Mask Detection Project

This project is designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It leverages a pre-trained model to analyze images or video streams and identify whether the individuals in the frame are wearing a face mask.

## Features
- Real-time face mask detection in images and video streams.
- Classifies each face in the input as either "Mask" or "No Mask."
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accuracy.
- Supports both static image and live video inputs.
- User-friendly interface for easy testing and integration.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pillow
